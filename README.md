# passwordgenerator

This is a password generator that I'm creating. Basically, it gives the user the possibility to randomly create the password.

Thus, the messages will be displaying to ask the user about what he wants. From the beginning, it will ask the user how many character he wants. So, the user will have the option to choose from 8 to 128 characters. And then,  the user will have the option to choose if he wants his password to have lowercase, upper case, special character, numbers. Once the user makes his own choice, it will generate the password according to the user's choice.
