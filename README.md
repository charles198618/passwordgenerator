# passwordgenerator

## Description 

This is a password generator that I'm creating. Basically, it gives the user the possibility to randomly create the password.

Thus, the messages will be displaying to ask the user about what he wants. From the beginning, it will ask the user how many character he wants. So, the user will have the option to choose from 8 to 128 characters. And then,  the user will have the option to choose if he wants his password to have lowercase, upper case, special character, numbers. Once the user makes his own choice, it will generate the password according to the user's choice.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to solve a problem in society. Nowadays, many people loose datas such as documents, pictures, even money because they don't have a strong password. But with this project, the user will be able a generate a very strong password that will help users to protect  sensitive informations or datas on internet.


## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.   

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to use the conditional such as if and satisfies our the customers needs. Also, the use of for and while loops were the biggest challenges.
